# Curriculum Vitae for Kenji Hayashi

This repo is for building my CV using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and my [`qmdcv`](https://github.com/kthayashi/qmdcv) R package. This package allows me to provide the content of my CV as structured data (via .yml files), insert those data into a .qmd document, and render the CV using Quarto. The [Paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/) library is used to print the rendered HTML document as a PDF document.
